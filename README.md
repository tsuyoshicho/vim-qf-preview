The popup window will always have the same width as the quickfix window.


## Usage

In the quickfix window navigate the cursor to the desired error and press
<kbd>p</kbd> to open a popup window with the file containing the error. The
window is scrolled such that the buffer line with the error is at the top of the
window.

The following keys can be used while the popup window is visible:

| Key               | Description                                 | Configuration           |

| <kbd>Ctrl-j</kbd> | Scroll buffer down one text line.           | `qfpreview.scrolldown`  |

| <kbd>-</kbd>      | Decrease height of popup window by one line.| -                       |


## Configuration

#### b:qfpreview and g:qfpreview

The default key mappings and the height of the popup window can be changed
through the variable `b:qfpreview` in `after/ftplugin/qf.vim`, or alternatively
through the global variable `g:qfpreview`. In addition to the `Dictionary` keys
listed in the above table, the initial height of the popup window can be set
through the `height` entry.

Example:
```vim
" in vimrc
let g:qfpreview = #{
    \ scrollup: 'k',
    \ scrolldown: 'j',
    \ halfpageup: 'u',
    \ halfpagedown: 'd',
    \ fullpageup: 'b',
    \ fullpagedown: 'f',
    \ close: 'q',
    \ height: 20
    \ }
```

#### Highlighting

The appearance of the popup window can be configured through the highlighting
groups `QfPreview`, `QfPreviewTitle`, `QfPreviewScrollbar` and `QfPreviewThumb`.
See `:help qfpreview-highlight` for more details.
